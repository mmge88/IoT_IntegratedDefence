# IoT_IntegratedDefence

The project proposes an integrated defence optimisation approach for IoT using network shuffling-based MTD and cyber deception.

The entry point of the project is Simulations.py. Simulations use an example network (fig-iot-example.png) and compare 12 schemes (when to shuffle and how to shuffle) and scheme with no defence. All parameters are set manually. Please change the global variables in Simulations.py (output_path and processor_num) before running the simulations.

### Requirements
* At least Python 3+
* Inspyred (https://github.com/aarongarrett/inspyred) for GA
* Matplotlib for visualising results
