# IoT_IntegratedDefence

## The project proposes an integrated defence optimisation approach for IoT using network shuffling-based MTD and cyber deception.

### The entry point of the project is Simulations.py. Simulations use an example network and compares 12 schemes (when to shuffle and how to shuffle) and scheme with no defence. All parameters are set manually. Please change the output_path and processor_num before running the simulations.
